# Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard is a tool designed for administrators to manage and interact with user data. It provides a user-friendly interface where admins can view, filter, edit, and delete user records. The dashboard includes features such as column titles for easy navigation, a search bar for quick filtering, and pagination to navigate through user entries efficiently. Admins can select and delete multiple rows simultaneously, and there's a convenient checkbox to select or deselect all rows on the current page. The dashboard ensures a seamless user experience with in-place editing and clear navigation options.
